## Hackathon information

Home Page: <http://it.droidcon.com/2018/hackathon/>

### Hackathon Sponsors

1. [AND Innovation Agency](http://and-italia.it/)
2. [Web Marketing Festival 2018](https://www.webmarketingfestival.it/)
3. [Google](http://www.google.com/)

### How does it work

* All hackathon participants meet on Saturday morning (14th April). The hackathon sponsors outline the themes for the hackathon, this year all under the umbrella of ‘**Android for Business**’, and the prizes associated to each theme. Participants pitch their ideas for development (the themes are also released in advance of the hackathon so that participants have the chance to pre-plan their ideas). 
* Everyone divides into teams and, for the rest of Saturday, overnight, and most of Sunday, works on developing & building the ideas into full fledged, operational solutions. 
* Sunday evening, work stops and each team presents their solution to the judges and all of the participants. 
* Thursday morning (19th April) the judges award the winner and runner-up prizes for each theme category after the opening droidcon conference keynote presentation. You can see more detail in the [hackathon rules](http://it.droidcon.com/2018/hackathon-rules/). 
* FYI, participants must bring their own hardware (i.e. laptop, PCs, mobile devices, extension cords, etc.)
